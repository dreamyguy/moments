With **Moments** one can do two things _(sometimes three)_:

1. Find how many years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes or seconds are there between two moments in time.

2. Find the exact moment in time when defining a specific time unit (years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes or seconds) relative to a 'base' moment.

3. If the resulting moment is in the future, one will have the opportunity to set a calendar event.

## API

Because results in **Moments** are presented in a structured way, one can use the application dynamically from somewhere else. One has two options:

1. Link to the **Moments** website on Github, passing the expected time parameters.

_Details on this are currently being refined_

2. Hit the **Moments** `API` directly to generate a `JSON` response with all the calculations made for the moment defined in the request. This can then be consumed by your own application.

_Details on this are currently being refined_

## Development

### Getting started

Clone this repo locally. You'll need to have [NodeJS][1] installed. Install all dependencies by running:

    npm i

If not already present, you need [Watchman][8] to run the test with `--watch` flag. You can install it in a number of ways, but I recommend using [Homebrew][12]:

    brew install watchman

### Run it locally

To start the app locally, run:

    npm run dev

This command fires up the application on port `9876`, making it visible on http://localhost:9876. Because this app is based on [create-react-app][3], the port number should be configured on the [.env](https://github.com/wtfoo/moments/blob/master/.env#L1) file.

### Building the frontend for Production

When you're ready to build for production, run:

     npm run build

This command compiles all production-optimised resources to a folder called **build**. It's meant to be run remotely, at the environment host, at build time.

### Running frontend tests

To test the application remotely (Jenkins, Travis, etc) , run:

    npm run test

For the best integration experience while developing, run (it will start the `--watch` flag):

    npm run test:local

It's recommended to keep tests running locally as one develops. Running tests on your IDE's terminal window, kept visible while you're writing the application would be for instance a great place to start. [VS Code][13] supports that natively.

Tests can be written in different ways, but [Jest][4] _(for unit tests)_ and [Enzyme][5] _(for integration tests)_ are good starting points. At this point _Enzyme_ still needs to be implemented.

### Gettings test coverage

Test coverage won't ever hit 100%, but can be used as a way to trace exceptions/exclusions. If a file shouldn't be tested, [it should be ignored by tests](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#testpathignorepatterns-array-string). That way test coverage is kept at an acceptable level.

To run test coverage, run:

    yarn test:coverage

### About

**Moments** was conceived and developed by [Wallace Sidhr√©e][1]. is written in [React][4], with [Redux][5] used for state management. It was initialized through [create-react-app 2][6] and built upon that with some sensible strategies. [Jest][7] and [Enzyme][9] are used for tests. [Momentjs][10] is used for time calculations. [VS Code][13] was used as the IDE of choice.

It's a project made out sheer fun &mdash; to honour, acnowledge and nourish the _geekiness_ in all of us. It is, therefore, a part of [WTFoo][11], a tiny but mighty group of skilled developers that celebrate exactly that.
